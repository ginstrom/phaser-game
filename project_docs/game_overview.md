# Game Mechanics

## Resources

There are four types of planetary resources:
- mineral
- organic
- radioactive
- exotic

Each planet and asteroid has a production value for each of these resource types, ranging from 0 to 100.
The production values can be adjusted upward or downward by various bonuses/penalties, and planetary improvements/degradations (terraforming/bombardment) can raise/lower them permanetly.

Each empire has a store of each resource, which is filled by resource production and depleted by unit production and upkeep.

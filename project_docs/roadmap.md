## Project Roadmap

Based on the project state, I'd recommend focusing on these areas:

### 1. Turn Processing System
This is mentioned in your current_task.md and seems critical:
- Implement the turn logic (resource calculation, action resolution)
- Create a clear processing sequence for turns
- Add resource production calculations based on planets/asteroid belts

### 2. Frontend Game Scene
The frontend needs significant work:
- Implement a galaxy map view to show systems and empires
- Create UI components for resource display and empire management
- Build a system view to interact with planets and asteroid belts
- Connect the frontend to the backend API

### 3. Integration Layer
- Implement API service in the frontend to communicate with the backend
- Add authentication (if needed for multiplayer)
- Create data caching strategies for game state

### 4. Game Mechanics
- Implement empire actions (colonize, build, research)
- Add technology trees and research mechanics
- Create ship/fleet models and combat systems
- Design victory conditions

### 5. Testing and Polishing
- Add more frontend tests
- Implement end-to-end testing
- Optimize performance for larger games
- Add more visual polish and effects

## Immediate Recommendation

I'd focus on implementing the turn processing system first since it's fundamental to gameplay. This includes:

1. Add a `process_turn` method to the Game model
2. Implement resource production calculations
3. Create empire actions (build, research, etc.)
4. Add a turn phases system (production, movement, combat, etc.)

Once the backend turn processing is working, I'd focus on building out the frontend galaxy map and system views to make the game playable.

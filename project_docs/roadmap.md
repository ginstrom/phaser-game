## Project Roadmap

Based on the project state, I'd recommend focusing on these areas:

### 1. Turn Processing System
This is mentioned in your current_task.md and seems critical:
- ✅ Implement basic turn ending functionality
- ✅ Create API endpoint for turn processing
- ⏳ Implement the turn logic (resource calculation, action resolution)
- ⏳ Create a clear processing sequence for turns
- ⏳ Add resource production calculations based on planets/asteroid belts

### 2. Frontend Game Scene
The frontend needs significant work:
- ✅ Implement basic galaxy map view to show systems and empires
- ✅ Create UI components for turn management
- ✅ Build a component-based UI system for front end
  - ✅ Implement SciFiButton component
  - ✅ Standardize button usage across scenes
  - ⏳ Create form input components
  - ⏳ Create panel components
- ⏳ Build a system view to interact with planets and asteroid belts
- ⏳ Add resource display and empire management UI
- ⏳ Connect all frontend components to the backend API

### 3. Integration Layer
- ✅ Implement basic API service in the frontend
- ⏳ Add authentication (if needed for multiplayer)
- ⏳ Create data caching strategies for game state
- ⏳ Implement real-time updates for multiplayer

### 4. Game Mechanics
- ⏳ Implement empire actions (colonize, build, research)
- ⏳ Add technology trees and research mechanics
- ⏳ Create ship/fleet models and combat systems
- ⏳ Design victory conditions

### 5. Testing and Polishing
- ⏳ Add component tests for UI elements
- ⏳ Add integration tests for game flow
- ⏳ Implement end-to-end testing
- ⏳ Optimize performance for larger games
- ⏳ Add more visual polish and effects

## Immediate Recommendation

I'd focus on completing the UI component system next:

1. Create standardized form components:
   - Text inputs with sci-fi styling
   - Number inputs with validation
   - Dropdown/select components
   
2. Implement panel components for:
   - System view
   - Empire management
   - Resource display
   
3. Add proper form validation and error handling to:
   - New game setup
   - Empire management forms
   - Resource allocation

Once the UI components are complete, focus on implementing the turn processing system as it's critical for gameplay.

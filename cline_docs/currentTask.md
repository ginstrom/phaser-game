# Current Task

## Current Objective
Convert string values in the backend to enums using a shared JSON configuration file.

## Context
The backend currently uses string literals for various game elements like planet types, galaxy sizes, and difficulty levels. Converting these to enums will improve type safety, reduce errors, and make the codebase more maintainable. Using a shared JSON file will allow these enums to be synchronized between the Python backend and TypeScript frontend in the future.

## Plan
1. **Create a config directory** at the project root to house shared configuration files
2. **Create an enums.json file** with definitions for:
   - PlanetType (rocky, terrestrial, oceanic, etc.)
   - GalaxySize (small, medium, large)
   - Difficulty (easy, normal, hard)
3. **Create a config.py file** in the backend to load and use these enums
4. **Update backend models** to use the new enum types
5. **Update backend services** to use the enum values
6. **Test the changes** to ensure everything works correctly

## Completed Actions
1. ✅ Created a config directory at the project root to house shared configuration files
2. ✅ Created an enums.json file with definitions for:
   - PlanetType (rocky, terrestrial, oceanic, etc.)
   - GalaxySize (small, medium, large)
   - Difficulty (easy, normal, hard)
3. ✅ Created a config.py file in the backend to load and use these enums
4. ✅ Updated backend models to use the new enum types:
   - Updated Planet.type to use PlanetType enum
   - Updated Galaxy.size to use GalaxySize enum
   - Updated GameState.difficulty to use Difficulty enum
5. ✅ Updated backend services to use the enum values:
   - Updated generate_planet function to use PlanetType enum
   - Updated generate_galaxy function to use GalaxySize enum
   - Updated create_new_game function to use Difficulty and GalaxySize enums
6. ✅ Updated docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.test.yml to mount the config directory in the backend containers
7. ✅ Updated config.py to look for the enums.json file in both local and Docker environments
8. ✅ Ran the backend tests to verify all tests pass with the new enum implementation

## Previous Task (Completed)
### Objective
Fix the failing unit test in the frontend related to the InputField component.

### Results
- Fixed the issue with the InputField component by using the correct method to create a Graphics object
- Updated the Phaser mock to better support the InputField component
- All tests are now passing

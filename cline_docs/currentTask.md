# Current Task

## Current Objective
Always display the system name even if it is not explored

## Context
This task is part of improving the user experience and ensuring consistent behavior in the game UI. Currently, unexplored systems are displayed with "???" instead of their actual names. The requirement is to always display the system name, regardless of whether it has been explored or not, to provide better information to the player.

## Completed Actions
1. ✅ Examined the GalaxyScene.ts file to understand how system names are displayed
2. ✅ Identified three locations where system names were conditionally displayed based on explored status:
   - In the create method, where the text for each system is added
   - In the onSystemHover method, where the tooltip text is displayed
   - In the onSystemClick method, where the title of the info panel is set
3. ✅ Modified all three locations to always display the system name, regardless of explored status
4. ✅ Verified that the changes maintain the visual distinction between explored and unexplored systems (color difference)

## Results
- System names are now always displayed, even for unexplored systems
- This provides better information to the player, allowing them to identify systems by name before exploring them
- The visual distinction between explored and unexplored systems is maintained through color differences
- The game's UI is now more informative and user-friendly

## Next Steps
1. Implement functionality for the other endpoints (load game, settings, exit game)
2. Connect the frontend to these endpoints
3. Implement data store for game state

## Previous Objective (Completed)
Document the galaxy view appearance after starting a new game

## Context
This task is part of understanding the current state of the game's UI and functionality. We need to document what the galaxy view looks like after starting a new game, which will help us understand how the game state is being displayed and what improvements might be needed.

## Observations
Based on the provided screenshot of the galaxy view after starting a new game:

1. **Player Information Panel**:
   - Located in the top-left corner
   - Shows player name (Player527)
   - Displays player resources:
     - Credits: 1000
     - Minerals: 500
     - Energy: 200

2. **Galaxy View Title**:
   - "Galaxy View" displayed at the top of the screen

3. **Star Systems**:
   - Multiple star systems displayed as gray circles throughout the galaxy
   - Most systems are unexplored and labeled with "???"
   - Two systems are labeled:
     - "System 5" (appears to be explored)
     - "System 1" (highlighted in yellow, indicating it's the player's starting system)

4. **System Representation**:
   - Different sized circles represent different star systems
   - Gray circles indicate unexplored systems
   - Yellow/highlighted circle indicates the player's current or starting system

## Code Implementation
The galaxy view is implemented in the GalaxyScene.ts file:

1. **Player Resources Panel**:
   - Created using the Panel class
   - Resources are retrieved from the GameState singleton
   - Fallback values are provided if resources are missing

2. **Star Systems Generation**:
   - Systems are generated based on the galaxy size from the game state
   - Systems are positioned in a circular pattern around the center of the screen
   - The first system (System 1) is marked as explored by default
   - System sizes vary randomly

3. **System Interaction**:
   - Systems are interactive (clickable)
   - Hovering over a system shows its name
   - Clicking on a system shows an info panel
   - Explored systems can be viewed in detail
   - Unexplored systems can be explored

## Next Steps
1. Enhance the galaxy view with more visual elements:
   - Add background stars or nebulae
   - Improve the visual distinction between explored and unexplored systems
   - Add visual indicators for system resources or threat levels

2. Implement functionality for the other endpoints:
   - Load game
   - Settings
   - Exit game

3. Implement data store for game state

## Previous Objective (Completed)

# Current Task

## Current Objective
Implement basic game UI components

## Context
This task is part of the "Implement basic game UI components" goal from projectRoadmap.md. We need to create UI components for the different game views as outlined in the GameStructure.md document.

## Planned Actions
1. ✅ Create scene files for each game view:
   - ✅ StartupScene.ts (Main menu)
   - ✅ GalaxyScene.ts (Galaxy view)
   - ✅ SystemScene.ts (System view)
   - ✅ PlanetScene.ts (Planet view)
2. ✅ Implement UI components for each scene:
   - ✅ Buttons, text, and other interactive elements
   - ✅ Navigation between scenes
3. ✅ Create reusable UI components:
   - ✅ Button class
   - ✅ Panel class
   - ✅ Text styles
4. ✅ Update the main game configuration to include all scenes
5. ✅ Test the UI components and navigation

## Completed Steps for Current Task
1. ✅ Created a UI directory for reusable components
2. ✅ Implemented Button class for interactive buttons
3. ✅ Implemented Panel class for UI panels and windows
4. ✅ Created TextStyles for consistent text styling

6. ✅ Implemented GalaxyScene with star systems
7. ✅ Implemented SystemScene with planets and orbits
8. ✅ Implemented PlanetScene with planet details and management
9. ✅ Added navigation between scenes
10. ✅ Updated main game configuration to include all scenes

## Completed Steps
1. ✅ Set up the project directory structure
2. ✅ Initialize npm project and install dependencies (Phaser, TypeScript, etc.)
3. ✅ Configure TypeScript
4. ✅ Create a basic HTML entry point
5. ✅ Create a minimal Phaser game instance that displays a blank screen
6. ✅ Set up a simple development server (webpack-dev-server)
7. ✅ Create Docker configuration for development
8. ✅ Test the setup by launching the browser with the blank Phaser game
9. ✅ Created the docs/ directory
10. ✅ Created the GameStructure.md file with the specified structure
11. ✅ Updated the README.md to include a link to the new GameStructure.md file

## Next Steps
1. Develop game scenes and states
2. Set up the FastAPI backend
3. Implement data store for game state

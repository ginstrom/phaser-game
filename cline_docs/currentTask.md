# Current Task

## Current Objective
Configure docker-compose to run PostgreSQL for the data store.

## Context
The project needs a persistent data store for game state. PostgreSQL has been chosen as the database solution for the production environment, while SQLite will be used for testing.

## Completed Actions
1. ✅ **Updated docker-compose.yml** to include a PostgreSQL database service:
   - Added a `db` service using the `postgres:13-alpine` image
   - Configured environment variables for database name, username, and password
   - Added a volume for persistent data storage
   - Updated the backend service to connect to the database with the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
   - Added a dependency from the backend to the database service

## Next Steps
1. Update the backend code to use the database connection
2. Create database models for game state
3. Implement database migrations
4. Update the game service to store and retrieve game state from the database

## Previous Task (Completed)
### Objective
Enable automatic reloading for the frontend in Docker Compose when code changes are made.

### Results
1. ✅ **Modify webpack.config.js** to enable polling for file watching in Docker environment:
   - Initially added `watchOptions: { poll: true }` to the devServer configuration
   - Updated to use `watchFiles: { paths: ['src/**/*'], options: { poll: true } }` to match the current webpack-dev-server API
2. ✅ **Test the changes** to ensure automatic reloading works correctly:
   - Restarted Docker Compose to apply the changes
   - Made a test change to the StartupScene.ts file
   - Verified that webpack detected the change and automatically recompiled the code
   - Confirmed that the frontend is accessible and displays correctly with the changes

## Previous Task (Completed)
### Objective
Use enums.json config file for enum values in the frontend.

### Results
1. ✅ Updated docker-compose.yml to mount the config directory in the frontend container:
   - Added volume mapping: `./config:/app/config`
2. ✅ Updated docker-compose.test.yml to mount the config directory in the frontend test containers:
   - Added volume mapping: `./config:/app/config` to all frontend services
3. ✅ Created a utility file in the frontend to load and use the enums from the config file:
   - Created `frontend/src/utils/enums.ts` with functions to load and use enums
   - Created a local copy of enums.json in the frontend/src/utils directory
   - Implemented direct import of the JSON file instead of fetching it
   - Created helper functions for working with enums in UI components
4. ✅ Updated the StartupScene.ts file to use the enums from the utility file:
   - Imported the utility functions
   - Modified the startNewGame method to load enums and use them for select fields
   - Used getSelectOptions and getDefaultValue functions to populate the select fields
5. ✅ Updated webpack.config.js to copy the config directory to the dist directory:
   - Added a new pattern to the CopyWebpackPlugin configuration
6. ✅ Verified that the frontend is now using the enum values from the config file:
   - Tested the New Game dialog and confirmed that the dropdowns are populated with the correct values

## Previous Task (Completed)
### Objective
Convert string values in the backend to enums using a shared JSON configuration file.

### Results
- Created a config directory with enums.json file
- Created a config.py file in the backend to load and use these enums
- Updated backend models and services to use the enum values
- Updated docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.test.yml to mount the config directory in the backend containers
- Ran the backend tests to verify all tests pass with the new enum implementation

## Previous Task (Completed)
### Objective
Fix the failing unit test in the frontend related to the InputField component.

### Results
- Fixed the issue with the InputField component by using the correct method to create a Graphics object
- Updated the Phaser mock to better support the InputField component
- All tests are now passing

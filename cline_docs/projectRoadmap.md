## Project Goals
- [x] Create a basic project skeleton with Phaser and TypeScript
- [x] Set up Docker and docker-compose for development
- [x] Implement basic game UI components
- [x] Create tests for the basic Phaser skeleton and ensure all tests pass
- [~] Develop FastAPI backend for game logic
  - [x] Create backend skeleton with stub endpoints for start menu options
  - [~] Implement actual functionality for the endpoints
    - [x] Implement new game endpoint
    - [ ] Implement load game endpoint
    - [ ] Implement settings endpoint
    - [ ] Implement exit game endpoint
  - [x] Connect frontend to backend
- [~] Implement data store for game state
  - [x] Configure PostgreSQL database in docker-compose
  - [x] Create database models and schema using synchronous SQLAlchemy
  - [ ] Implement database migrations
  - [ ] Update services to use the database
- [ ] Create basic game mechanics (movement, resources, etc.)
- [ ] Implement turn-based system
- [ ] Add multiplayer capabilities
- [ ] Polish UI and game experience

## Key Features

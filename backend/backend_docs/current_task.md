# Current Task

## Completed
- Implemented basic celestial models (Star, Planet, AsteroidBelt)
- Implemented System model with orbit management
- Added Player and Race models
- Added Empire model with resource management
- Implemented API endpoints for all models
- Added comprehensive tests
- Updated documentation
- Fixed validation issues in Game model
- Improved System coordinate uniqueness handling
- Fixed test suite issues and improved test coverage
- Implemented basic turn processing system
  - Added turn.py module with process() function
  - Changed game turn to start at 0
  - Updated API endpoints to use turn processing
  - Added comprehensive tests for turn processing

## Next Steps
1. Add resource production calculations
2. Add empire actions (colonize, build, research)
3. Implement game state management
4. Add victory conditions

## Plan of Action
1. Design resource production system
   - Define resource types and calculations
   - Plan production modifiers
   - Design storage mechanics
2. Implement resource production
   - Add production calculations
   - Add storage management
   - Add resource overflow handling
3. Add empire actions
   - Design action system
   - Implement basic actions
   - Add validation and costs
4. Add game state
   - Design state tracking
   - Implement state transitions
   - Add victory checking
5. Testing and documentation
   - Add comprehensive tests
   - Update API documentation
   - Add game rules documentation

## Notes
- Keep following test-driven development practices
- Maintain documentation as features are added
- Consider performance implications for game mechanics
- Plan for future scaling of empire management
- Always review development_process.md before adding new models

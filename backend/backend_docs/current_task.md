# Current Task

## Recently Completed
- Implemented Star model with star type classification
  - Added Star model with enum field for star types
  - Created and applied database migrations
  - Implemented REST API endpoints
  - Added comprehensive test coverage
  - Updated documentation
- Created development process documentation
  - Documented model addition workflow
  - Added testing and migration procedures
  - Included best practices and reminders
- Implemented System model with comprehensive features
  - Added System model with x,y coordinates
  - Created one-to-one relationship with Star
  - Created one-to-many relationships with Planet and AsteroidBelt
  - Implemented orbit constraints and validation
  - Added System API endpoints with CRUD operations
  - Added custom actions for adding planets and asteroid belts
  - Created comprehensive test coverage
  - Updated all relevant documentation

## Current Status
- Basic celestial models (Star, Planet, AsteroidBelt) are in place
- System model implemented with all relationships
- REST API endpoints are implemented and tested
- Documentation is up to date
- Docker environment is properly configured

## Next Steps
1. Implement game mechanics
   - Design resource production calculation system
   - Create turn-based mechanics
   - Implement game state management
   - Add resource collection and storage logic
2. Add player/empire functionality
   - Create Player/Empire model
   - Add ownership of systems
   - Implement resource management
   - Add diplomatic relations
3. Implement game rules
   - Add turn processing
   - Create colonization mechanics
   - Implement resource trading
   - Add victory conditions

## Plan of Action
1. Design and implement resource production system
   - Create production calculation formulas
   - Add production modifiers based on star type
   - Implement resource collection mechanics
   - Add storage management
2. Begin player/empire implementation
   - Design empire model
   - Plan ownership and control mechanics
   - Consider diplomatic relationships
3. Start game mechanics implementation
   - Design turn processing system
   - Plan colonization rules
   - Consider trade mechanics

## Notes
- Keep following test-driven development practices
- Maintain documentation as features are added
- Consider performance implications for game mechanics
- Plan for future scaling of empire management
- Always review development_process.md before adding new models

# Current Task

## Completed
- Implemented basic celestial models (Star, Planet, AsteroidBelt)
- Implemented System model with orbit management
- Added Player and Race models
- Added Empire model with resource management
- Implemented API endpoints for all models
- Added comprehensive tests
- Updated documentation
- Fixed validation issues in Game model
- Improved System coordinate uniqueness handling
- Fixed test suite issues and improved test coverage
- Implemented basic turn processing system
  - Added turn.py module with process() function
  - Changed game turn to start at 0
  - Updated API endpoints to use turn processing
  - Added comprehensive tests for turn processing
- Implemented resource production system
  - Added production calculations for planets and asteroid belts
  - Implemented storage management with capacity limits
  - Added comprehensive logging for resource tracking
  - Added tests for resource calculations
- Added comprehensive logging system
  - Implemented logging for game start process
  - Added logging for turn processing
  - Added detailed resource tracking logs
  - Configured appropriate log levels for different operations

## Next Steps
1. Add empire actions (colonize, build, research)
2. Implement game state management
3. Add victory conditions

## Plan of Action
1. Design empire action system
   - Define action types and requirements
   - Plan resource costs and prerequisites
   - Design action validation rules
2. Implement basic actions
   - Add colonization mechanics
   - Add building system
   - Add research system
3. Add game state
   - Design state tracking
   - Implement state transitions
   - Add victory checking
4. Testing and documentation
   - Add comprehensive tests
   - Update API documentation
   - Add game rules documentation

## Notes
- Keep following test-driven development practices
- Maintain documentation as features are added
- Consider performance implications for game mechanics
- Plan for future scaling of empire management
- Always review development_process.md before adding new models
- Monitor resource calculation performance with large empires
- Consider adding metrics collection for resource production

# Current Task

## Recently Completed
- Implemented Star model with star type classification
  - Added Star model with enum field for star types
  - Created and applied database migrations
  - Implemented REST API endpoints
  - Added comprehensive test coverage
  - Updated documentation

## Current Status
- Basic celestial models (Star, Planet) are in place
- REST API endpoints are implemented and tested
- Documentation is up to date
- Docker environment is properly configured

## Next Steps
1. Implement relationship between Star and Planet models
   - Add foreign key from Planet to Star
   - Update API endpoints to handle relationships
   - Add nested serialization
2. Add system coordinates for celestial bodies
   - Implement coordinate system
   - Add position fields to models
   - Update API to handle spatial queries
3. Add game mechanics
   - Implement resource production calculations
   - Add turn-based mechanics
   - Create game state management

## Plan of Action
1. Design and implement the Star-Planet relationship
   - Update models with relationships
   - Modify serializers to include nested data
   - Update API endpoints
   - Add relationship tests
2. Add spatial positioning system
   - Research best approach for 2D space coordinates
   - Implement chosen solution
   - Add position-based queries
3. Begin game mechanics implementation
   - Start with resource production system
   - Add turn processing logic

## Notes
- Keep following test-driven development practices
- Maintain documentation as features are added
- Consider performance implications for spatial queries
- Plan for future scaling of game mechanics
